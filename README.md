In this repository, I explore fundamental data structures implemented in Java, enhancing my understanding of algorithms and their applications. Each section provides insights into various data structures, with a focus on practical examples and coding techniques.

Arrays
Definition and Characteristics: Arrays are a collection of elements, all of the same type, stored in contiguous memory locations, allowing for efficient indexing.

Implementation in Java: Demonstrated the syntax and structure for declaring, initializing, and accessing arrays in Java.

Common Operations: Explored essential operations like traversing, searching, and sorting arrays, including algorithms like linear search and bubble sort.

Use Cases: Illustrated practical applications of arrays in solving problems such as finding duplicates and merging sorted arrays.

Challenges Faced: Addressed challenges like handling array boundaries and optimizing performance for large datasets.
